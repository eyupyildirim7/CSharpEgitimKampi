# 🚀 C# BOOT CAMP PROJECTS

This repo contains the first 10 projects I completed during the C# Bootcamp taught by Murat Yücedağ. Each project helped me improve my ability to understand and apply specific programming concepts. Below you can find the technical details of each project:

## ✨ Project 1: Hello World!
In this project, I learned how to print to the console. I explored basic printing operations with the Console.WriteLine() command and understood the structure of a C# program. 🌍

## ✨ Project 2: Variables
In this project, I learned to define and use variables of different data types such as int, string, double. I tried to perform operations on data types and variables. 🔢

## ✨ Project 3: Arrays
In this project, I learned how to work with arrays. I discovered how to store multiple values in an array and how to manipulate these values with loops. 🧩

## ✨ Project 4: Decision Structures (If-Else)
With this project, I created decision mechanisms using if, else if and else constructs. I tested how the program behaves according to different conditions. ⚖️

## ✨ Project 5: Loops
In this project, I was introduced to for, while and foreach loops. With loops, I gained the ability to automate repetitive operations and process large data sets. 🔄

## ✨ Project 6: Methods
I learned how to create methods to make my code more organized and reusable. I tried to write methods that take parameters and return results. 🛠️

#✨ Project 7: Foreach Cycle and Examination System
In this project, I took a closer look at the foreach loop and created a simulation of an exam system. I took students' exam grades, calculated their averages and determined their pass/fail status. 🎓

## ✨ Project 8: Backward Returning Functions
In the last project, I worked with methods that return back values. I created functions that process the data I receive from the user and return the results. With this project, I learned more complex operations. 🎗️

## ✨ Project 9: Database Based Product-Category Information System
In this project, I learned how to establish a database connection and extract data from the database. I developed an application that lists the relevant information on the screen by taking the table selection from the user. I connected to the database with SqlConnection and SqlCommand classes and experienced running queries. With this project, I gained important knowledge about database operations and data flow. 💾

## ✨ Project 10: Menu Order Processing Panel
In this project, I interacted with a database by performing basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. I implemented adding, listing, updating and deleting product and category information using SQL connection. Thanks to the project, I was able to save and query data to the database with SQL commands.


## ✨ Project 11: Eftravel Statistics Panel

In this project, I developed a statistics panel that queries and visualizes information in a travel database using Entity Framework. The project aimed to show various statistics live on Windows Forms to the user. 💻

The features included in the project are as follows:
Calculation of general information such as total number of locations, capacity, number of guides.
Display of statistical values such as average capacity and price.
Special filtering of data for a specific city or country.
Identifying the cities with the highest values such as maximum capacity and price.
Finding the number of tours a particular guide is responsible for.

Achievements
I learned how to use Entity Framework to connect to the database, query and filter with LINQ statements more effectively.
I designed a user-friendly interface by visualizing the information in the database on the Windows Forms application.
I added functionality to the project by processing query results effectively. 📊
This project not only helped me improve my database knowledge but also increased the impact of the application by providing a visual result. 

Thanks to these projects, I had the opportunity to learn the basic concepts of the C# language in practice. I will further develop this knowledge in future projects!
